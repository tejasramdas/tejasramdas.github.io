			<p>I'm a <span id="year">first-year</span> graduate student in the <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/">Program in Neuroscience</a> at Harvard University advised by <a href="https://gershmanlab.com/index.html">Sam Gershman</a>. I'm interested in studying the principles of learning and memory in single neurons and single-celled organisms. Previously, I studied computational neuroscience and philosophy at the University of Southern California.</p>
			<p>You've found me on the interwebs but I'd love to meet in person! Please reach out :)</p>
